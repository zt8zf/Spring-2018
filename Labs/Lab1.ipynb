    "# Lab 1: Introduction to Jupyter and Git\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Extends the console-based approach providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Jupyter notebook we will use the interface provided on the `lsit.ucsb.edu` server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Go to https://jupyterhub.lsit.ucsb.edu and sign-in with a gmail account or your ucsb.edu account.\n",
    "    2. Click on \"Start my Server\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I will assume that you have access to Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic idea: Git is an example of a *version control system*, or VCS.\n",
    "- It is a tool that allows to track the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to the latest Stack Overflow developer survey, more than 70 percent of developers use Git.\n",
    "- Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. \n",
    "- Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s a repository?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forking\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://github.com/ and create a Github account.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will not create our own repo but rather we will \"fork\" the course repo to our own account. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of *forking* is to modify an existing repo which we may not have access to.\n",
    "- For example, try clicking on \"Creating New File\" button (it won't allow you to modify the current repo).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign-in on Github.\n",
    "2. In the search bar type `UCSB-PSTAT-134-234/Spring-2018` in order to find the class repo.\n",
    "3. Click on \"Fork\" button on the upper-right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be able to see that the course repo `Spring-2018` is now under your username.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting your username in Git\n",
    " \n",
    "Git uses a username to associate commits with an identity. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the name that is associated with your Git commits using the ``git config`` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Changing the name associated with your Git commits using git config will only affect future commits and will not change the name used for past commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting your Git username for every repository on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global user.email \"s_rodriguezhernandez@ucsb.edu\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global user.name \"Sergio\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now proceed to *clone* the forked repo to our local working environment in order to create new files or modify existing files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Within Jupyter notebook, create a new terminal window (drop down menu New>Terminal).\n",
    "2. Go to Github and copy the url of the repo (in my case https://github.com/checorh/Spring-2018.git).\n",
    "\n",
    "`` git clone \"https://github.com/checorh/Spring-2018.git\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examine the repo locally using shell commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic terminal commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "``pwd``: \"print current directory\"\n",
    "\n",
    "``ls``: listing\n",
    "\n",
    "``--help``: oututs options and description for a given command.\n",
    "\n",
    "``cd``: Change directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching and commiting\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Navigate to the main repo folder `cd Spring-2018`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "``git branch develop``\n",
    "\n",
    "``git branch``\n",
    "\n",
    "``git checkout develop``\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make changes to that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "``git status``\n",
    "\n",
    "``git commit\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "``git add``\n",
    "\n",
    "``git commit -m \"commit message\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can stage and comming using:\n",
    "\n",
    "``git commit -am \"commit message\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to your terminal window and navigate to the top level of your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "``cd Spring-2018``\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the git status command to be sure you have all your changes committed and find out what branch you have checked out.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git status`\n",
    "On branch future-plans\n",
    "nothing to commit, working directory clean\n",
    " \n",
    "Switch to the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout master`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Make sure you have the latest repo version by **pulling** all contents before merging your branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "``git pull``\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge changes from the future-plans branch into the master branch.  It will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``git merge develop`` \n",
    "\n",
    "Because you don't plan on using ``develop`` anymore, you can delete the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "``git branch -d develop``\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter ``git status`` to see the results of your merge, which show that your local repository is one ahead of your remote repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pushing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once changes have been made locally you are ready to update your changes in your remote repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git push origin master` \n",
    "\n",
    "> You will be asked your Github user name and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of basic Git commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like **GitHub** Desktop or [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below I enlist some of the most commonly used Git commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone` creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add` stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git commit` saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git status` shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git branch` shows the branches being worked on locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git merge` merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git pull` updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git push` updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.\n"
